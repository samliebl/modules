Let’s compare the two prompts—the **Original Prompt (March 25, 2025)** and the **Modular Template (current version)**—to highlight their differences. Then, I’ll suggest ways the current modular template could be enhanced to be even more detailed and robust.

---

### Key Differences Between the Original Prompt and the Modular Template

1. **Input Flexibility**  
   - **Original**: Requires a marketing message (string) only. No option for deriving it from text or customizing the CTA.  
     - Example: "self-deprecating humor and intelligence"  
   - **Modular Template**: Requires a marketing message and CTA, both dynamic, with an optional text input to inspire the message if needed. Prompts the user if inputs are missing.  
     - Example: Message: "exploring character contrast in moral ambiguity", CTA: "stack.samliebl.com", Text (optional): [transcript]  
   - **Difference**: The modular template is more flexible, allowing user-driven inputs and fallback derivation, while the original is rigid with a fixed CTA ("Subscribe to stack.samliebl.com").

2. **CTA Handling**  
   - **Original**: Hardcodes "Subscribe to stack.samliebl.com" as the CTA, limiting adaptability.  
   - **Modular Template**: Makes the CTA a required, dynamic input (e.g., "[INSERT CTA HERE]"), adaptable to any link or phrase.  
   - **Difference**: The modular version supports varied goals (e.g., subscriptions, clicks, sign-ups), while the original is subscription-focused.

3. **Hashtag Research**  
   - **Original**: Dynamically researches 5-10 hashtags per channel with no fixed rules, based on trends as of March 21, 2025.  
     - Example: Threads: #FantasyReads #EpicSecrets #ShadowTales #SerialMystery #DarkPlans2025  
   - **Modular Template**: Researches hashtags as of [CURRENT DATE] (e.g., March 28, 2025) with fixed rules: Threads (#bookthreads only), Instagram (+#bookstagram), TikTok (+#booktok #booktoklive), Bluesky (+#booksky), X (+#booktwtr), others get 5 researched tags.  
     - Example: Threads: #bookthreads, Instagram: #bookstagram #MoralTales #CharacterDepth #FantasyAmbiguity #StoryContrast  
   - **Difference**: The modular template enforces consistent branding via fixed hashtags and limits Threads to one, while the original allows more hashtag flexibility per channel.

4. **Post Generation Style and Specificity**  
   - **Original**: Generates posts with a generic hook tied to fantasy subscriptions, no explicit video context, and LinkedIn spun for business growth.  
     - Example: "Secrets whispered in shadows—fantasy tales of loyalty and hidden plans. Nobarre’s story unfolds at https://bit.ly/MadtaCh2"  
   - **Modular Template**: Tailors hooks to the exact message, assumes video context (adjustable), and refines platform styles (e.g., TikTok POV, LinkedIn leadership focus).  
     - Example: "Video: Exploring character contrast in moral ambiguity—gray heroes steal the show. See it at stack.samliebl.com"  
   - **Difference**: The modular template is more precise in style and context (video-specific), while the original is broader and less platform-distinct.

5. **Character Limits and Validation**  
   - **Original**: Lists character limits but doesn’t specify visible portions or validation steps explicitly.  
     - Example: Threads (500 chars), Instagram (2,200 chars)  
   - **Modular Template**: Details visible limits (e.g., Instagram ~125 chars visible) and includes a validation step to ensure fit and tone.  
     - Example: Threads (500 chars), Instagram (2,200 chars, ~125 visible)  
   - **Difference**: The modular template is more detailed and rigorous in managing constraints.

6. **Date Handling**  
   - **Original**: Fixed to March 21, 2025, for hashtag research.  
   - **Modular Template**: Uses [CURRENT DATE] (e.g., March 28, 2025), making it adaptable to any date.  
   - **Difference**: The modular version is timeless, while the original is tied to a specific point.

7. **Instructions and User Interaction**  
   - **Original**: Simple instructions, no prompting for missing inputs.  
     - Example: "Provide your marketing message..."  
   - **Modular Template**: Detailed instructions with active prompting for missing message or CTA.  
     - Example: "If either is missing, I’ll ask for it..."  
   - **Difference**: The modular template is more interactive and user-friendly.

### How the Modular Template Could Be Enhanced for More Detail

Here are ways to make the current modular template even more detailed and powerful:

1. **Granular Audience Segmentation**  
   - **Current**: Targets "fantasy serial novel readers" (LinkedIn: business pros).  
   - **Enhancement**: Add an optional input for audience sub-segments (e.g., "YA fantasy fans," "grimdark enthusiasts," "creative entrepreneurs") to tailor hooks and hashtags further.  
     - Example Input: Audience: "YA fantasy fans"  
     - Output: TikTok: "POV: Moral ambiguity hooks YA hearts—see it at [CTA] #booktok #booktoklive #YAFantasy #MoralVibes #TeenReads"  

2. **Content Type Specification**  
   - **Current**: Assumes video posts implicitly.  
   - **Enhancement**: Add an input for content type (e.g., video, image, text) to adjust post structure explicitly (e.g., image captions vs. video teasers).  
     - Example Input: Content Type: "Image"  
     - Output: Instagram: "Image: Moral ambiguity in sharp contrast—explore it at [CTA]—link in bio! #bookstagram..."  

3. **Hashtag Volume Control**  
   - **Current**: Fixed hashtag counts (e.g., Threads: 1, TikTok: 5).  
   - **Enhancement**: Add an optional input for hashtag quantity per channel (e.g., "Threads: 1, Instagram: 3") to balance visibility and clutter.  
     - Example Input: Hashtags: "Instagram: 3"  
     - Output: Instagram: "... #bookstagram #MoralTales #CharacterDepth"  

4. **Tone Customization**  
   - **Current**: Platform styles are predefined (e.g., TikTok: punchy, LinkedIn: professional).  
   - **Enhancement**: Add an optional tone input (e.g., "witty," "mysterious," "inspirational") to override or refine default styles.  
     - Example Input: Tone: "Witty"  
     - Output: X: "Moral ambiguity? More like a character plot twist party. Join at [CTA] #booktwtr #MoralFiction #CharacterCraft #FantasyEdge"  

5. **Analytics Integration**  
   - **Current**: No performance tracking.  
   - **Enhancement**: Include a placeholder for post-performance analysis (e.g., "Tag this post with [UNIQUE ID] for engagement tracking") and suggest A/B testing variants.  
     - Example Output: Facebook: "... See it at [CTA] [PostID: FB001] #FantasyReaders... (Variant A: Try 'Who’s right?' hook)"  

6. **Visual or Media Descriptions**  
   - **Current**: No guidance for accompanying visuals.  
   - **Enhancement**: Add an optional output section for suggested media (e.g., "Video: 15-sec clip of a shadowy figure debating morality").  
     - Example Output: YouTube: "... Suggested Media: Video—close-up of a conflicted hero, dim lighting, tense music."  

7. **Cross-Platform Linking**  
   - **Current**: Each post stands alone.  
   - **Enhancement**: Add optional cross-references (e.g., "See the full story on YouTube at [CTA]") to drive traffic across channels.  
     - Example Output: Threads: "... Check the deep dive on YouTube at [CTA] #bookthreads"  

8. **Time-Sensitive Adjustments**  
   - **Current**: Static date for hashtag research.  
   - **Enhancement**: Add an optional urgency parameter (e.g., "Event: March 30, 2025") to tweak posts for time-bound campaigns.  
     - Example Input: Urgency: "Event: March 30, 2025"  
     - Output: Bluesky: "Moral ambiguity unfolds—catch it by March 30 at [CTA] #booksky..."  

9. **Character Limit Warnings**  
   - **Current**: Validates fit but doesn’t warn explicitly.  
   - **Enhancement**: Add a detailed validation report (e.g., "X: 164/280 chars—safe; CTA exceeds limit by 5 chars, suggest shortening").  
     - Example Output: "Validation: Instagram: 210/2,200 chars, ~125 visible—hook fully visible."  

10. **Language Localization**  
    - **Current**: Assumes English.  
    - **Enhancement**: Add an optional language input (e.g., "Spanish") to generate translated posts with localized hashtags.  
      - Example Input: Language: "Spanish"  
      - Output: X: "Explorando contrastes en ambigüedad moral—míralo en [CTA] #booktwtr #FicciónMoral #ArtesaníaPersonajes #Fantasía2025"

### Summary of Differences and Potential
The **Modular Template** is already a significant evolution from the **Original Prompt**, offering dynamic inputs (message and CTA), stricter hashtag rules, video context, and better user interaction. The original is simpler and less customizable, with a fixed CTA and broader hashtag approach.

To make the modular template even more detailed, enhancements like audience segmentation, tone customization, and media suggestions would add depth and precision. These upgrades would turn it into a comprehensive social media toolkit, adaptable to diverse campaigns and analytics-driven strategies. Which enhancement interests you most, or want to test one with your last message ("exploring character contrast in moral ambiguity")?
