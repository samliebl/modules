Master Image Prompt for Consistent Visual Style (Medieval Fantasy Comic Aesthetic):

A minimalist, semi-realistic comic book-style illustration set in a grounded medieval fantasy world. The scene should emphasize clean, sharp linework, bold composition, and a muted yet rich color palette—earthy tones like deep reds, worn blues, dusty ochres, pale grays, pine greens, and cold steel. Lighting is natural and dramatic, using long shadows, low sun, torchlight, or mist to evoke mood. The visual tone is contemplative, tense, or solemn, never exaggerated or cartoonish.

Characters should wear historically-inspired attire from the 11th–12th centuries, with strict adherence to Norman-style armor if applicable—chainmail hauberk, conical helmet, simple surcoat with subtle heraldry, leather belts with engraved buckles, and realistic weapons like swords, spears, and shields. Hair, fabric, and metal textures should feel tactile and lived-in. Faces are expressive, often serious, showing the quiet strength, weariness, or purpose of life in a hard world. Horses, falcons, goats, and other animals may appear as companions, equipped with minimal medieval tack.

Environments are sparse but evocative: high valleys (like the Shenandoah), alpine ridges (like the Rockies or Sierra Nevada), desolate plateaus, forested ruins, foggy moorland, or medieval encampments. The landscapes should feel vast and humbling, with subtle environmental storytelling—trampled grass, distant banners, broken weapons, cairns, or watchfires. Use atmospheric perspective and negative space to create emotional depth.

Optional main character: Eathel, a young noble and warrior (~20 years old) with noble, angular features, dark slightly wavy hair, and deep amber honey-brown eyes. Wears Norman chainmail and a dark surcoat with heraldic embroidery. His sword, Cuáwevephy essisava, rests in a high scabbard at his hip. His presence should feel calm, alert, and quietly commanding—charisma through posture, not flair.

Style balance: grounded medieval realism meets clean comic-style illustration, suitable for a narrative graphic novel or character reference sheet. Avoid modern elements or overt fantasy tropes. Use weather, terrain, and natural lighting to convey time, place, and tone. Scene focus can vary: battle, travel, rest, council, or solitude. Dialogue or caption boxes may be included in a subtle hand-drawn comic font.
