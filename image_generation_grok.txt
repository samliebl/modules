Painterly Style Rendering Prompt (High Art Fantasy Graphic Novel Style)

Render the input image in a painterly style inspired by modern graphic novel promo paintings, emphasizing a high art fantasy aesthetic. The final image should emulate a hand-painted original with a matte finish and visible brushwork, resembling traditional oil painting on canvas or wood panel, while capturing the dynamic, immersive qualities of contemporary fantasy illustrations.

Base Painterly Style
Brush Strokes: Visible and textured, with dynamic, expressive strokes that convey movement and depth. Use thick, layered applications (e.g., impasto-like techniques) to create a tactile quality.
Color Blending: Soft and gradual transitions between colors, avoiding sharp edges unless stylistically intentional, to enhance depth and atmosphere.
Lighting: Dramatic, with strong contrasts between light and shadow to emphasize form and mood. Light typically originates from a single, identifiable source (e.g., upper left or frontal) to highlight textures and contours.
Composition: Structured to guide the viewer’s eye through the scene, using techniques like leading lines, focal points, or balanced placement of subjects against a complementary background.

Modern Graphic Novel Promo Paintings (High Art Fantasy)
Composition: Dynamic and immersive, with a focus on storytelling and atmosphere. Scenes should feel expansive and cinematic, often with a sense of depth or layered elements.
Lighting: Dramatic and moody, often with a mix of natural and magical light sources. Use chiaroscuro and volumetric lighting to create depth and highlight key elements.
Color Palette: Rich and varied, balancing warm and cool tones to create contrast and depth. Colors should evoke a fantastical, otherworldly feel while remaining grounded in a painterly tradition.
Detail: Highly detailed, with a focus on textures, patterns, and intricate designs, all rendered in a painterly style. Emphasize elements like ornate armor, flowing fabrics, or mythical creatures.
Style: A blend of realism and stylization, with a touch of whimsy and fantasy. Figures and environments should feel tangible yet imbued with a sense of magic or wonder.

Additional Styles (Optional)
Artist Influences: [ARTIST\_NAME] (e.g., influences from modern fantasy illustrators like [ARTIST\_NAME], or classical painters adapted to a fantasy context).
Techniques: [TECHNIQUE] (e.g., heavy impasto for texture, meticulous detailing of fantastical elements, or dynamic brushwork for action scenes).

Color Palette (Optional)
Specified Palette: [COLOR\_PALETTE] (e.g., vibrant and fantastical hues, or muted and atmospheric tones).
Default: A balanced mix of warm (e.g., golds, reds) and cool (e.g., blues, purples) tones to maintain harmony and contrast, inspired by the rich palettes of fantasy art.

Historical Accuracy (Optional)
Time Period: [TIME\_PERIOD] (e.g., medieval fantasy, Renaissance-inspired, or entirely fictional).
Details: Ensure elements like clothing, architecture, and objects align with the chosen setting, avoiding anachronisms unless intentionally blending eras for a fantastical effect.

Mood/Thematic Elements (Optional)
[MOOD/THEME]: [Describe desired mood or themes, e.g., epic and adventurous, dark and foreboding, or mystical and serene].
