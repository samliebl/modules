A digital illustration in a semi-realistic style blending medieval and romantic elements. Characters are rendered with clean linework, soft but detailed facial features, and strong directional lighting that enhances form without excessive shading. Colors are muted and earthy, with limited saturation, relying on contrast between light and dark zones to emphasize depth. Armor and textiles are stylized with minimal texture and symmetrical heraldic symbols. Ethereal or holy figures emit soft glowing outlines, contrasting against more grounded, shadowed characters. Composition is balanced between two focal figures in the foreground, with supporting characters and banners receding in layered background vignettes. Halo or radiance motifs are applied sparingly and iconographically. Expression and posture communicate solemnity, tension, or quiet authority. Use of medieval symbolism is restrained and integrated. Backgrounds are narrative but flattened, serving as contextual tapestry rather than full environments. Consistent line weight, clear figure-ground separation, and compositional symmetry define the aesthetic.
