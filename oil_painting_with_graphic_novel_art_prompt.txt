Updated Image Generation Prompt (Plain Raw Text):

Render the input image in a composite style that blends:
	•	75% of the stylized realism, angularity, and clean character construction of the Saga comic series (as seen in the included visual references):
	•	Minimal but expressive linework with confident contours
	•	Subtle anatomical exaggeration (especially in jawline, brow, and hands)
	•	Characters posed with weight and gesture clarity
	•	Clothing drapes cleanly, with hard-to-soft folds emphasized selectively
	•	Body language conveys mood economically; framing is symbolic, not busy

With:
	•	25% of the painterly, impasto, emotionally resonant oil-on-canvas technique defined previously:
	•	Visible brush drag and stroke layering
	•	Subtle edge blending in skin and fabrics
	•	High color density with jewel tones and ambient shadows
	•	Hand-painted matte surface simulation

Additional technical parameters:
	•	Brushwork:
Base linework remains dominant, clean, and illustrative. Overlaid painterly textures should soften interior form but not interfere with silhouette clarity.
	•	Line and Edge Definition:
Maintain Saga-style edge fidelity. Emphasize edges via both dark lines and chromatic contrast. Let inner areas carry painterly brushwork without cluttering outlines.
	•	Color Application:
Use nearest-match colors from the Chameleon palette for all regions. Apply Pre-Raphaelite principles of saturation control—warm shadows, cool light, layered pigments.
	•	Lighting:
Use directional ambient light with stylized bounce reflections. Employ chiaroscuro subtly within folds and faces. Avoid synthetic lighting artifacts.
	•	Composition and Depth:
Maintain figure-forward composition typical of comic panels. Use background gradients or abstract fields to avoid over-detail. Reinforce narrative focus.
	•	Facial and Anatomical Rendering:
Match Saga’s structure—heroic stylization, lean musculature, angular facial planes, subtle asymmetry. Express emotion through posture and gaze.
	•	Materials and Textiles:
Retain comic-style block tones in garments, but layer painterly textures on top for depth. Armor and metal use dulled contrast and textured glaze rather than high gloss.
	•	Mood and Symbolism:
Slightly mythic, emotionally restrained, visually clean. Backgrounds and expressions support story energy without overcrowding.
	•	Medium Simulation:
Digital emulation of mixed media—comic line art overlaid with oil-paint textures. Final output should appear as an illustration hybrid between high-end cover art and cinematic comic panel.

Apply this configuration to any image. Maintain subject scale and pose fidelity. Visual output must appear intentional, stylized, and emotionally grounded—retaining narrative immediacy while elevating surface texture and compositional clarity.
