# module: certain style of fantasy artwork based on aesthetic of works like "Saga" and "Watchmen."

The artwork is rendered in a high-quality graphic novel style, with bold, expressive linework and dynamic panel composition.
The color palette is rich but slightly muted, often using dramatic contrast, limited halftones, and occasional splashes of vibrant color for emphasis.
Shadows and lighting create a cinematic, moody atmosphere, reminiscent of noir storytelling.
Characters have exaggerated but realistic proportions, detailed facial expressions, and strong silhouettes.
The inking is heavy and deliberate, with sharp contrasts between light and dark.
Backgrounds are highly detailed, often incorporating surreal or futuristic elements blended with grounded, lived-in environments.
The overall aesthetic evokes the storytelling depth of modern graphic novels like Saga and the gritty realism of Watchmen, balancing hyper-stylization with emotional depth.
