% twilight tonalist

Got it — you want a modular style framework that can be applied to any uploaded image, transforming it into the twilight-tonalist oil painting style of the sky image above, using the Chameleon color palette as the adaptive color basis. Here’s the modular definition, ready for machine parsing and cross-application:

⸻

✅ STYLE MODULE: “Twilight Tonalist Atmospheric Render”

Purpose: Apply this consistent style to any input image — portrait, landscape, architecture, or object — by reinterpreting the subject through the tonal, luminous, and moody characteristics described.

⸻

Brushwork & Rendering Technique

Medium Simulation: Oil on canvas
Texture: Soft-blended skies, matte finish, low impasto
Foreground Detail: Linear, fine-brushed (for trees, wires, outlines)
Background: Smoothed gradients with tonal layering
Edge Treatment: Subtle feathering; use chromatic contrast over linework

Lighting Logic

Time of Day: Twilight (post-sunset, pre-night)
Light Source: Ambient residual light from below the horizon
Contrast: High (silhouetted foreground vs illuminated sky/cloud)
Shadows: Cool, deep indigo or blue-black
Highlights: Warm glow, usually on clouds or reflective surfaces

Composition & Depth

Orientation: Flexible (portrait or landscape)
Depth Creation: Atmospheric desaturation in distance
Framing: Foreground silhouettes (trees, rooftops, figures) anchor frame
Focal Point: Luminous sky area or light-bearing surface

Mood & Symbolism

Tone: Reflective, quiet, sacred
Emotional Resonance: Solitude, reverence, duskiness
Symbolic Lighting: Light suggests fading or transition



⸻

✅ COLOR INTEGRATION: Chameleon Palette Mapping

How to use it within this system:
1.	Extract dominant hues from the input image.
2.	Match each to the nearest Chameleon color (via closest hex value).
3.	Replace source hue with Chameleon match in each painted stroke.
4.	Maintain contrast and gradient logic — don’t flatten shadows or highlights.
5.	Use Chameleon hues not just for fidelity, but to reinforce mood-appropriate tones:
•	Highlights: Use #FEA829, #FFCC2F, #F0DEB7
•	Shadows: Use #2B2B2B, #354A5D, #2D3E50, #262626
•	Sky: #2F81B8, #3B9AD9, #EDF1F2, #BEC4C8
•	Trees/foreground: #2E5037, #5E4536, #503B2D

✅ USAGE TEMPLATE (summary)

Input: Image
Process:
1.	Analyze subject → isolate figure vs background
2.	Apply “Twilight Tonalist Atmospheric Render” style
3.	Replace color spectrum with nearest-match from Chameleon palette
4.	Preserve lighting logic: warm glow vs deep shadows
5.	Output: oil painting aesthetic, emotionally resonant, subdued matte texture

Let me know if you want this wrapped as a callable preset format or expanded into variants (e.g., morning version, snowlight version, etc).
