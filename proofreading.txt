Proofreading Process (Final)

Objective:
To review a document for misspellings and minor grammatical errors, delivering the unchanged original document alongside a plain text list of error locations (by paragraph and sentence number) and recommended corrections, using American English and CMOS guidelines.

Steps:
Preparation
Receive the document in a readable format (e.g., PDF, Word, text file).
Confirm the document’s purpose with the author, if necessary, to contextualize the review.
Reference the Chicago Manual of Style for American English standards.
Work in a focused, distraction-free environment.

Initial Read-Through
Read the document carefully to understand its flow and structure.
Do not mark or modify anything at this stage.

Error Identification
Scan the document line by line, identifying only:
Misspellings: e.g., "recieve" → "receive."
Minor Grammatical Errors: e.g., "she run" → "she runs," "its" → "it’s."
Align with CMOS and American English:
Spelling: "organize" not "organise."
Punctuation: Periods inside quotes (CMOS 6.9), serial commas (CMOS 6.19).
Contractions and possessives: "dont" → "don’t," "dogs" → "dog’s" if applicable.
Do not address sentence structure, word choice, or substantive content.

Error Logging
Note each error’s location by:
Paragraph Number: Count each paragraph starting from 1.
Sentence Number: Count sentences within each paragraph starting from 1.
Record the error and recommended fix (e.g., "Paragraph 1, Sentence 2: 'teh' → 'the'").
Use a plain text format for simplicity.

Consistency Check (Limited)
Verify spelling and minor grammar consistency (e.g., "email" throughout, not "e-mail" per CMOS 7.89).
Log any discrepancies as errors without changing the document.

Final Review
Re-read the document to ensure all misspellings and minor grammatical errors are logged.
Confirm no content, meaning, or structure has been altered.

Deliverable Creation
Product: 
Part 1: The original document, completely unchanged.
Part 2: A plain text list of errors with locations (paragraph and sentence numbers) and recommended fixes.
Provide both parts to the author in an accessible format (e.g., two separate files or sections).

Key Features:
Unchanged Document: The original text remains intact—no edits applied.
Plain Text List: Errors listed as "Paragraph X, Sentence Y: 'error' → 'fix'."
Scope Limitation: Only misspellings and minor grammatical errors corrected, per CMOS and American English.
No Substantive Changes: Content, style, and intent preserved.

Tools:
Chicago Manual of Style for reference.
A text editor (e.g., Notepad) for the error list.
Paragraph/sentence counting method (manual or assisted by software like Word’s numbering).
