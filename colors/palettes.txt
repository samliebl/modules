Prompt: 'palettes'

Description: This prompt defines three color palettes—"Chameleon," "Solarized," and "Solarized Dark"—for use in image rendering. Users can add colors to these palettes or create and save new ones for future use. All palettes are modular and can be swapped out during rendering.

Current Palettes:

1. Chameleon:
Hex Values: #FEA829, #FFCC2F, #FFD56C, #FFE4A3, #FFF1D5, #F0DEB7, #E6C49C, #D5C298, #A38673, #5E4536, #3B2C1E, #2E5037, #4B6C4B, #6A8759, #88A35D, #B3C96B, #DDE593, #F6F5E2, #EDF1F2, #BEC4C8, #9BA7AD, #839496, #657b83, #586E75, #354A5D, #2D3E50, #262626, #1C1C1C, #E64E42, #BF3A31, #8A2C23, #FF8869, #FFB6A3, #D25519, #CB6B2C, #B06A2C, #8C4721, #715031, #FF9E1B, #FFC845, #FFDA79, #FFF0B3, #FFFFE5, #6C71C4, #888BE6, #A7A9F9, #2AA198, #38B2AC, #51C3B6, #7BD1C9, #A9E0DD, #D1F0EF, #FDF6E3
Notes: A vibrant, versatile palette with a wide range of hues for flexible rendering.

2. Solarized:
Hex Values: #002b36, #073642, #586e75, #657b83, #839496, #93a1a1, #eee8d5, #fdf6e3, #b58900, #cb4b16, #dc322f, #d33682, #6c71c4, #268bd2, #2aa198, #859900
Notes: The original Solarized palette, balanced for contrast and aesthetic harmony.

3. Solarized Dark:
Hex Values: #002b36, #073642, #586e75, #657b83, #839496, #93a1a1, #eee8d5, #fdf6e3, #b58900, #cb4b16, #d30102, #d33682, #6c71c4, #268bd2, #2aa198, #859900
Notes: A dark-themed variant of Solarized, differing slightly in red tone (#d30102 vs. #dc322f).

User Instructions:
Add Colors to Existing Palettes: To add colors to "Chameleon," "Solarized," or "Solarized Dark," provide the palette name and new hex values (e.g., "Add #FFFFFF to Solarized"). Duplicate colors will be automatically excluded to maintain uniqueness.
Create New Palettes: To create a new palette, provide a unique name and a list of hex values (e.g., "Create palette 'Midnight' with #1A1A1A, #2B2B2B"). The new palette will be saved for future use.
Use Palettes: Specify a palette name during image rendering requests to apply it (e.g., "Render an image using Solarized Dark"). Palettes are modular and can be swapped as needed.
View Palettes: Request a list of all saved palettes with their colors by saying, "Show all palettes."
Remove Colors or Palettes: To remove specific colors, provide the palette name and hex values (e.g., "Remove #FEA829 from Chameleon"). To delete a palette, specify its name (e.g., "Delete palette Solarized").
Future Use: All palettes are stored and accessible across sessions unless deleted. Modifications (additions, removals) are saved automatically.

Constraints:
Hex values must be valid (e.g., #FFFFFF or #FFF format).
Palette names must be unique.
Duplicate hex values within a palette are automatically removed.
Palettes must contain at least one color to be valid.

Example Commands:
"Add #000000, #111111 to Solarized Dark"
"Create palette 'Neon' with #FF00FF, #00FFFF"
"Show all palettes"
"Remove #d30102 from Solarized Dark"
"Delete palette Chameleon"

System Notes:
The system will validate hex codes before adding them.
New palettes are saved with the provided name and colors, marked as modular for rendering.
Modifications to palettes (additions, removals) are logged to ensure consistency.
If a user requests rendering without specifying a palette, prompt for clarification or suggest available palettes.

Implementation Notes:
The original "Solarized" palette has been restored with its distinct red (#dc322f), while "Solarized Dark" retains #d30102.
All three palettes—"Chameleon," "Solarized," and "Solarized Dark"—are now defined in the 'palettes' prompt.
The system checks for duplicates when adding colors (e.g., #FEA829 was deduplicated in Chameleon).
Users can add colors to any palette, create new ones, or modify existing ones, with changes saved for future use.
Palettes remain modular for rendering, and the system supports swapping them as needed.
