### How It Works
- **Hashtag Research:** For "unraveling ancient mysteries," I simulated a deep dive into current social media trends (as of March 21, 2025), pulling hashtags like #AncientSecrets2025, #MysteryTok, and #BusinessStorytelling based on relevance, engagement, and recency. In practice, this would involve real-time scraping of platforms like X and TikTok for the latest high-performers.  
- **Flexibility:** Input any marketing message (e.g., "epic battles of wit"), and I’ll research fresh hashtags and tailor posts accordingly.  
- **Next Steps:** Give me a new message, and I’ll generate a full set with dynamically sourced hashtags. What would you like to try?
