<!--social media modular prompt-->

I’ve synthesized a new, improved version of the prompt by integrating the best elements from the original, the current modular template, and your latest feedback. This version enhances detail and flexibility while adding a dedicated sub-process for trend research by channel.

Synthesized Modular Social Media Marketing Prompt with Channel-Specific Trend Research

Description:  
This advanced, customizable prompt generates optimized social media posts across eight channels, targeting fantasy serial novel readers (and business professionals for LinkedIn). It uses user-provided inputs for marketing message and CTA, with an optional audience segment and tone, and features a detailed, channel-specific trend research sub-process using real-time data (e.g., X, web trends as of [CURRENT DATE]). Posts are tailored to each channel’s style, audience, content type (e.g., video, image), and character limits, with LinkedIn spun for career/business growth and fixed hashtag rules applied.

Inputs:  
- Marketing Message (string, required): A brief core idea (e.g., "exploring character contrast in moral ambiguity"). If omitted, I’ll prompt: "Please provide a marketing message!"  
- Call to Action (CTA, string, required): A short link or phrase (e.g., "stack.samliebl.com"). If omitted, I’ll prompt: "I need a CTA—please provide one!"  
- Text (optional): A passage or snippet to inspire the message (e.g., "[INSERT TEXT HERE]").  
- Audience Segment (optional): Specific target group (e.g., "YA fantasy fans," "creative entrepreneurs"). Defaults to "fantasy serial novel readers" (LinkedIn: "business pros").  
- Content Type (optional): Post format (e.g., "video," "image," "text"). Defaults to "video."  
- Tone (optional): Desired voice (e.g., "witty," "mysterious"). Defaults to platform-specific styles.  
- Date (optional): Date for trend research (defaults to [CURRENT DATE], e.g., "March 28, 2025").  

Operation:  
1. Define Channels and Limits:  
   - Threads (500 chars), Instagram (2,200 chars, ~125 visible), Facebook Page (63,206 chars, ~480 visible), TikTok (2,200 chars, 80 for bio), Bluesky (300 chars), X (280 chars), YouTube (5,000 chars, 100 for titles), LinkedIn (3,000 chars).  

Handle Inputs:
Use "[INSERT MESSAGE HERE]" directly. If missing, prompt user. If text is provided without a message, suggest a hook (e.g., "Suggested: [DERIVED MESSAGE]—confirm or provide your own!").
Apply "[INSERT CTA HERE]" as specified.
Set audience to "[INSERT AUDIENCE]" or default. Adjust LinkedIn to business pros if unspecified.
Set content type to "[INSERT TYPE]" or "video."
Set tone to "[INSERT TONE]" or default to platform styles (e.g., TikTok: punchy, LinkedIn: professional).

Channel-Specific Trend Research Sub-Process:
Process: Conduct a detailed, real-time analysis of trends for each channel as of [CURRENT DATE], tied to "[INSERT MESSAGE HERE]" and "[INSERT AUDIENCE]".
Method:
Threads: Analyze X and web for casual, reader-focused trends (e.g., serial fiction buzz). Fixed: #bookthreads.
Instagram: Search Instagram and X for visual, bookish trends (e.g., #Bookstagram communities). Fixed: #bookstagram + 4 tags.
Facebook Page: Use Facebook and web data for long-form reader engagement (e.g., group discussions). 5 tags.
TikTok: Scrape TikTok and X for short-form, viral trends (e.g., #BookTok challenges). Fixed: #booktok #booktoklive + 3 tags.
Bluesky: Check Bluesky and X for niche, emerging trends (e.g., indie reader circles). Fixed: #booksky + 4 tags.
X: Analyze X for concise, trending topics (e.g., real-time fantasy chatter). Fixed: #booktwtr + 4 tags.
YouTube: Search YouTube and web for long-form content trends (e.g., book reviews). 5 tags.
LinkedIn: Use LinkedIn and web for professional trends (e.g., storytelling in business). 5 tags.
Prioritize high engagement (likes, shares), recency (within 30 days), and relevance to audience/message.
Output:
Threads: #bookthreads
Instagram: #bookstagram \#[TAG1] \#[TAG2] \#[TAG3] \#[TAG4]
Facebook Page: \#[TAG1] \#[TAG2] \#[TAG3] \#[TAG4] \#[TAG5]

YouTube: \#[TAG1] \#[TAG2] \#[TAG3] \#[TAG4] \#[TAG5]
LinkedIn: \#[TAG1] \#[TAG2] \#[TAG3] \#[TAG4] \#[TAG5]

Generate Posts: For each channel:
Hook: Craft  Craft a hook using "[INSERT MESSAGE HERE]", tailored to "[INSERT AUDIENCE]" and "[INSERT TONE]". Tie to fantasy serials (LinkedIn: business angle).
CTA: Add "[INSERT CTA HERE]", adapting placement (e.g., "link in bio" for Instagram/TikTok).
Content Type: Adjust for "[INSERT TYPE]" (e.g., "Video: [HOOK] at [CTA]").

Instagram: Visual, teaser.
Facebook Page: Engaging, detailed.
TikTok: POV, snappy.

X: Sharp, punchy.

LinkedIn: Professional, strategic.
Hashtags: Apply channel-specific tags from step 3.
Output: Plain text with character counts (titles separate for YouTube).

Validation:
Check character limits (e.g., X: 280 chars).
Warn if exceeded (e.g., "X: 290/280—shorten CTA by 10 chars").
Ensure tone and audience alignment.

Instructions for User:  
- Provide a marketing message (e.g., "exploring character contrast in moral ambiguity") and CTA (e.g., "stack.samliebl.com"). Optional: Add text, audience (e.g., "YA fantasy fans"), content type (e.g., "video"), tone (e.g., "witty"), and date (e.g., "March 28, 2025").
