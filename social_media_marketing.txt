### Modular Social Media Marketing Prompt Template with Real-Time Hashtag Research

**Description**:  
This modular template generates tailored social media posts across eight channels, targeting fantasy serial novel readers (and business professionals for LinkedIn). It uses a user-provided marketing message and CTA, with real-time hashtag research based on current platform data (e.g., X, web trends as of [CURRENT DATE]). Posts are optimized for each channel’s style, audience, and character limits, with fixed hashtag rules per specified channels and LinkedIn spun for career/business growth.

**Inputs**:  
- **Marketing Message (string, required)**: A brief core idea (e.g., "[INSERT MESSAGE HERE]"). If omitted, the AI prompts: "Please provide a marketing message (e.g., 'gritty quests of survival')!"  
- **Text (optional)**: A passage or snippet to inspire the marketing message if the user needs help crafting one (e.g., "[INSERT TEXT HERE]").  
- **Call to Action (CTA, string, required)**: A short link or action phrase (e.g., "[INSERT CTA HERE]"). If omitted, the AI prompts: "I need a CTA (e.g., 'https://bit.ly/MadtaCh2')—please provide one!"  
- **Date (optional)**: Date for hashtag research (defaults to [CURRENT DATE], e.g., "March 28, 2025").  

**Operation**:  
1. **Define Channels and Limits**:  
   - Threads (500 chars), Instagram (2,200 chars, ~125 visible), Facebook Page (63,206 chars, ~480 visible), TikTok (2,200 chars, 80 for bio), Bluesky (300 chars), X (280 chars), YouTube (5,000 chars, 100 for titles), LinkedIn (3,000 chars).  

2. **Handle Marketing Message**:  
   - Use the user-provided message directly: "[INSERT MESSAGE HERE]". If none is given, prompt the user. If optional text is provided without a message, suggest a hook (e.g., "Suggested: [DERIVED MESSAGE]—confirm or provide your own!") but require confirmation.

3. **Real-Time Hashtag Research Function**:  
   - **Process**: Analyze hashtag trends across X, Instagram, TikTok, and web sources as of [CURRENT DATE] related to "[INSERT MESSAGE HERE]".  
   - **Method**:  
     - Search for tags tied to the message (e.g., #FantasyFiction for "quests").  
     - Prioritize high engagement, recency (within 30 days of [CURRENT DATE]), and relevance to fantasy readers (LinkedIn targets creative/business pros).  
     - Cross-reference platform trends, applying fixed hashtag rules.  
   - **Output**:  
     - Threads: #bookthreads (sole hashtag).  
     - Instagram: #bookstagram + 4 researched tags (e.g., #[TAG1] #[TAG2] #[TAG3] #[TAG4]).  
     - Facebook Page: 5 researched tags (e.g., #[TAG1] #[TAG2] #[TAG3] #[TAG4] #[TAG5]).  
     - TikTok: #booktok #booktoklive + 3 researched tags (e.g., #[TAG1] #[TAG2] #[TAG3]).  
     - Bluesky: #booksky + 4 researched tags (e.g., #[TAG1] #[TAG2] #[TAG3] #[TAG4]).  
     - X: #booktwtr + 4 researched tags (e.g., #[TAG1] #[TAG2] #[TAG3] #[TAG4]).  
     - YouTube: 5 researched tags (e.g., #[TAG1] #[TAG2] #[TAG3] #[TAG4] #[TAG5]).  
     - LinkedIn: 5 researched tags (e.g., #[TAG1] #[TAG2] #[TAG3] #[TAG4] #[TAG5]).  

4. **Generate Posts**: For each channel:  
   - **Hook**: Craft a platform-specific hook using "[INSERT MESSAGE HERE]", linking to fantasy serials (e.g., "epic tales").  
   - **CTA**: Incorporate "[INSERT CTA HERE]", adapting placement (e.g., "link in bio" for Instagram/TikTok).  
   - **Style**:  
     - Threads: Casual, conversational.  
     - Instagram: Visual tease, bio-friendly.  
     - Facebook Page: Engaging, slightly longer.  
     - TikTok: POV-style, punchy.  
     - Bluesky: Niche, concise.  
     - X: Sharp, tweetable.  
     - YouTube: Descriptive, title-driven.  
     - LinkedIn: Professional, growth-focused.  
   - **Hashtags**: Apply rules from step 3.  
   - **Output**: Plain text with character counts (titles separate for YouTube).

5. **Validation**: Ensure posts fit limits, maintain tone, and align with fantasy reader appeal (or business growth for LinkedIn).

**Instructions for User**:  
- Provide a marketing message (e.g., "[INSERT MESSAGE HERE]") and a CTA (e.g., "[INSERT CTA HERE]"). Optional: Include text to inspire your message (e.g., "[INSERT TEXT HERE]").  
- If either is missing, I’ll ask for it. I’ll research hashtags as of [CURRENT DATE] and generate posts for Threads (500 chars, #bookthreads only), Instagram (2,200 chars, #bookstagram included), Facebook Page (63,206 chars), TikTok (2,200 chars, #booktok #booktoklive included), Bluesky (300 chars, #booksky included), X (280 chars, #booktwtr included), YouTube (5,000 chars), and LinkedIn (3,000 chars).  
- Expect fantasy reader focus, with LinkedIn tailored for business pros.

### Example Usage
To use this template, replace the placeholders:
- **Marketing Message**: "exploring character contrast in moral ambiguity"  
- **CTA**: "stack.samliebl.com"  
- **Date**: "March 28, 2025"  
- **Text (optional)**: [Your transcript or snippet here]  

The AI would then:
1. Plug in "exploring character contrast in moral ambiguity" as the hook.
2. Use "stack.samliebl.com" as the CTA.
3. Research hashtags for March 28, 2025, per the rules.
4. Generate posts like those in my previous response.

This template is now modular and reusable. You can save it, share it, or tweak it further (e.g., add more channels, adjust hashtag counts). Want to test it again with new inputs or modify the structure? Let me know!
