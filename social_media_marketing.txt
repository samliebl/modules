Optimized Modular Social Media Marketing Prompt with Real-Time Hashtag Research  
Description:  
This advanced prompt takes a user-provided marketing message (or derives one from provided text) and generates tailored social media posts across eight channels, targeting fantasy serial novel readers (and business professionals for LinkedIn) with a concise CTA linking to https://bit.ly/MadtaCh2. It features a robust, real-time hashtag research function using current platform data (e.g., X, web trends as of March 25, 2025), ensuring posts are optimized for engagement, recency, and relevance. Posts adapt to each channel’s style, audience, and character limits, with LinkedIn spun for career and business growth.

Input:  
- Marketing Message (string, optional): A brief core idea (e.g., "tension at the edge of survival," "secrets whispered in shadows"). If omitted, I’ll extract a thematic hook from provided text (e.g., a quote).  
- Text (optional): A passage or story snippet to analyze for a marketing message if none is provided.  

Operation:  
1. Define Channels and Limits:  
   - Threads (500 chars), Instagram (2,200 chars, ~125 visible), Facebook Page (63,206 chars, ~480 visible), TikTok (2,200 chars, 80 for bio), Bluesky (300 chars), X (280 chars), YouTube (5,000 chars, 100 for titles), LinkedIn (3,000 chars).  

Derive Marketing Message (if needed):
If no message is provided, analyze the input text for a compelling theme (e.g., stakes, hope, intrigue) tied to fantasy serials, crafting a hook like "A glint of hope in a ruthless world."

Real-Time Hashtag Research Function:
Process: Conduct a live analysis of hashtag trends across X, Instagram, TikTok, and web sources as of March 25, 2025, related to the marketing message.
Method:
Search X posts and web data (e.g., trending hashtag lists) for tags tied to the message (e.g., #FantasyFiction for "secrets," #GrittyQuest for "survival").
Prioritize hashtags with high engagement (likes, shares), recency (active today or within 30 days), and relevance to fantasy readers (LinkedIn targets creative/business pros).
Cross-reference platform-specific trends (e.g., #BookTok for TikTok, #StorytellingEdge for LinkedIn).
Output: 5 trending, high-performing hashtags per channel, tailored to its audience and vibe.

Generate Posts: For each channel:
Hook: Craft a concise, platform-specific hook using the marketing message, linking to fantasy serials (e.g., "Madta’s tale" or "epic quests").
CTA: Include "Read at https://bit.ly/MadtaCh2" (22 chars), adapting placement (e.g., "link in bio" for Instagram/TikTok).

Output: Plain text with character counts (titles separate for YouTube).

Validation: Ensure posts fit character limits, maintain tone, and align with fantasy reader appeal (or business growth for LinkedIn).

Instructions for User:  
- Provide a marketing message (e.g., "gritty quests of survival") or a text snippet (e.g., a story quote).
