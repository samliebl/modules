The following updates have been incorporated into the Synthesized Modular Social Media Marketing Process:
	1.	Plain Text Output Only
All outputs will be delivered exclusively in human-readable plain text, following a clear structure with channel name, post content, and character count in parentheses.
	2.	Removal of Proprietary Hashtags
Automatically exclude proprietary or brand-specific hashtags (e.g., #EathelTheBastard). Only general, thematic, and platform-relevant hashtags will be used.
	3.	Emoji Integration
Each generated post will include one to three relevant emojis, aligned with the theme, tone, and platform style. Emojis will enhance engagement without exceeding character limits.
